TASK: Run end-to-end engagement analysis for a fiscal period using a WIP Excel extract.

PARAMETERS (edit these as needed):
- INPUT_FILE: <your_file_name.xlsx>          # e.g., WIPs*.xlsx
- DETAIL_SHEET: Detail                       # name of the transactional sheet
- HEADER_ROW_INDEX: 7                        # 0-based row index where headers begin
- FY_START: <YYYY-MM-DD>                     # fiscal start (e.g., 2025-07-01)
- FY_END: <YYYY-MM-DD>                       # fiscal end   (e.g., 2026-06-30)
- BILLINGS: <number or M>                    # e.g., 20.11M (interpreted as 20,110,000)
- TARGET_MARGIN_PCT: <percent>               # e.g., 29
- BILLS_FILE: <Bills*.xlsx>                  # sheet "Engagement Partners"; columns: Engagement ID, Billing Partner (renamed to Engagement Partner)
- BOB_FILE: <BoB*.xlsx>                      # sheet "Export"; columns: Engagement ID, NUI ETD
- OUTPUT_FILE: <output.xlsx>                 # e.g. Engagement_Summary_FY26_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.xlsx 
- OUTPUT_SHEET: Summary

BUSINESS RULES (apply exactly):
1) Use **Accounting Date** to filter rows to [FY_START..FY_END]. If missing, use **Transaction Date**.
2) Treat **Expense Amount** as **pass-through revenue**.
3) For each row, then aggregate by **Engagement ID + Engagement Name**:
   - ANSR = "ANSR / Tech Revenue"
   - Margin Cost = "Margin Cost"
   - TER = ANSR + Expense Amount
   - Margin Amount = ANSR - Margin Cost
   - Margin % (on ANSR) = (Margin Amount ÷ ANSR) × 100
 4) Merge Engagement Partner from BILLS_FILE sheet "Engagement Partners" (rename "Billing Partner" -> "Engagement Partner"); if Partner is blank, copy from matching engagement with same name swapping Onshore/Offshore.
 5) Merge NUI ETD from BOB_FILE sheet "Export" by Engagement ID.

# EXECUTE Python script
   - "fy_engagement_analysis.py" -> for below DELIVERABLE in EXCEL SHEET FORMAT
   - # e.g. "fy_engagement_analysis.py --input WIPs.xlsx --sheet Detail --fy-start 2025-07-01 --fy-end 2026-06-30 --billings 17M --target-margin-pct 28 --bills Bills_08.12.2025.xlsx --bob BoB_08.12.2025.xlsx --output Engagement_Summary_FY26_Final.xlsx"

DELIVERABLES:
 A) Build Engagement Summary table (rounded to 2 decimals; sorted by TER desc) with columns:
   - Engagement ID
   - Engagement Name
   - ANSR / Tech Revenue
   - Margin Cost
   - Margin Amount
   - TER
   - Margin %
   - Hours
   - Engagement Partner
   - NUI ETD
   - Totals row uses SUBTOTAL for numeric columns (including NUI ETD); conditional formatting on NUI ETD: >0 red fill, <0 green fill.

   B) Build Employee Summary table (rounded to 2 decimals; sorted by "Level" desc, TER desc) with columns:
    - Employee / Product Name
    - Employee GUI / Product ID
    - Rank
    - Grade
    - Employee Region
    - Country / Region
    - Service Line
    - Hours
    - NSR 
    - ANSR 
    - Margin Cost 
    - Expense Amount 
    - #Engagements
    - #Opportunities
    - TER
    - Margin Amount
    - Margin % (on ANSR)
    - EAF (ANSR/NSR)
    Add column: "Level" 
      -  Rank: Partner/Principal = 7
      -  Rank: Executive Director = 6
      -  Rank: Senior Manager AND Grade: 2 = 5
      -  Rank: Senior Manager AND Grade: 1 = 4
      -  Rank: Manager = 3
      -  Rank: Senior = 2
      -  Rank: Staff/Assistant = 1     

   C) Month by Month Summary
      - Month
      - Hours
      - ANSR / Tech Revenue 
      - Margin Cost 
      - Expense Amount 
      - Margin Amount 
      - TER 
      - Margin %
   

D) KPI BRIDGE (compute and print at the top):
1) Parse BILLINGS (support “20.11M” or plain numbers). Compute **Write-on** = BILLINGS − (sum of TER).
2) **Revised Margin Amount** = (sum of Margin Amount) + Write-on.
3) **Revised Revenue** = (sum of ANSR) + Write-on.
4) **Revised Margin %** = Revised Margin Amount ÷ Revised Revenue × 100.
5) **Additional Revenue Needed** to reach TARGET_MARGIN_PCT with same cost:
   Solve x from (MarginAmount_total + x) / (ANSR_total + x) = TARGET_MARGIN_PCT%.


Save to Excel → OUTPUT_FILE (sheet OUTPUT_SHEET).

PRINT:
- Totals: ANSR_total, TER_total, MarginAmount_total, Margin%_overall (on ANSR), BILLINGS, Write-on
- Revised Margin Amount, Revised Revenue, Revised Margin %
- Additional Revenue Needed (to hit TARGET_MARGIN_PCT)
- Full Markdown table (sorted by TER desc)

NOTES:
- Keep column names identical to the source (“ANSR / Tech Revenue”, “Expense Amount”, “Margin Cost”, “Accounting Date”, “Transaction Date”, “Engagement ID”, “Engagement Name”).
- If header row differs, update HEADER_ROW_INDEX.
- If you also need EAF (ANSR ÷ NSR) or Hours, include “NSR / Tech Revenue” and “Charged Hours / Quantity” and add those columns similarly.
